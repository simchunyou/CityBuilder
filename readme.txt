CityBuilder Generator

  A python script that allows creation of custom cities as well as providing a calculation for object placements.
  The script also allows building generations and some traffic simulation.
  inspired by Sim City and other city simulation games.
  inspired by Anthony Scavarelli's work from http://portfolio.anthony-scavarelli.com/2012/01/27/autodesk-maya-city-builder/
  inspired and reference from Ramesh Balachandran's script on AI Traffic from https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0By0_WhpQpCZlWmNmaHYtMi1SbTQ&usp=sharing

Detailed examples of how the program can be used are in the artefacts\Videos section.
Create a project and import the textures into the source images folder.
To run the code, copy the code into the script editor and run it.
To enable the AI system, run in the expression editor: python(“update(“+frame+”)”);
